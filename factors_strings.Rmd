## Strings and regex
```{r}
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "nidhi")

str_detect(string_vec, "nidh")
str_replace(string_vec, "nidhi", "Nidhi")
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun",
  "it will be fun, i think"
)
str_detect(string_vec, "^i think") #the "^" means it's looking at the first part of the string
str_detect(string_vec, "i think$") #"$" after means look for it at the end
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "Y'all remember Pres. HW Bush?",
  "I saw a green bush",
  "BBQ and Bushwalking at Molonglo Gorge",
  "BUSH -- LIVE IN CONCERT"
)

str_detect(string_vec, "[Bb]ush") #in brackets to say it can either by capital or lower case b.
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "7th inning stretch",
  "1st half soon to begin, Texas won the toss.",
  "she is 5 feet 4 inches tall",
  "3AM = can't sleep :("
)

str_detect(string_vec, "[0-9][a-zA-Z]")
